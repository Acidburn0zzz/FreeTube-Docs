FreeTube provides a basic feature that allows you to download videos. You can find the download button while viewing a video and from there you will be given a range of download links.

## Types of Files

In this list of files, you'll notice the quality level and the frame rate of the video. You'll also notice that a majority of these files is either `video only` or `audio only`. This is because of how YouTube structures their videos (Please see the [Video Formats](/usage/video-formats) page for more information). If you'd like a video to also include audio, you'll have to download a file that does not include the `video only` or `audio only` suffix in the name.

Typically located at the bottom of the list, you'll also notice that you can download the available captions for a video as well.

## Downloading a Video

When you click on a link in the download list, FreeTube actually won't download a video. Instead, FreeTube will open up that file into your default web browser. This is done to save some development time on our end as we would have to create a new page to handle the downloads. Letting your browser handle it instead saves us time.

Once it's opened in your browser, you can right click and click on `Save Page As` in the pop-up menu to pick where you'd like to save your video.
