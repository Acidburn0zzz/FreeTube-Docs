# What is FreeTube?

FreeTube is an Open Source desktop application for Windows / Mac / Linux. It allows you to browse YouTube more privately compared to browsing on the site directly. Any data about you is stored locally on your own machine and is not sent or published to the internet. You can subscribe to your favorite channels and navigate the application in a similar manner to you would on YouTube.

## How Does it Work?

FreeTube does not use the official YouTube API. Instead, it parses the information it needs from the YouTube website in a similar manner to youtube-dl. FreeTube has two different API engines that it can use to otain information from YouTube. FreeTube has a built-in extractor (Dubbed the [Local API](/usage/local-api/)) or it can use the [API](/usage/invidious-api) from the [Invidious Project](/about/invidious).
